## Project Objectives
- Classify customer reviews into positive or negative sentiments.
- Preprocess text data using NLP techniques (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models to identify the most effective one.
- Provide actionable insights through sentiment analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python üêç
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` üóÇÔ∏è: Data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `numpy` üî¢: Numerical operations.
  - `nltk` üåê: Text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, stopwords).
  - `scikit-learn` üß†: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` üìä: Data visualization.
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and visualization.

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the dataset of customer reviews.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Remove punctuation, special characters, and stopwords.
   - Apply tokenization and lemmatization for better text representation.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Use TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Generate word clouds for positive and negative reviews.
   - Visualize model performance through confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Key Features
- **Automated Sentiment Classification**:
  - Classifies reviews as positive or negative based on text content.
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Word clouds and performance metrics for better interpretability.
- **Model Comparison**:
  - Compares multiple machine learning models to identify the most accurate one.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.7+ üêç.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn


## Results and Insights

- **Collected Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for each model.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Logistic Regression and SVM provided the best performance.
  - Word clouds revealed frequently used words in positive and negative reviews.
- **Example Visualizations:**
  - Confusion matrices and ROC curves for model evaluation.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate advanced NLP models like BERT or GPT for improved sentiment classification.
- Add multi-class sentiment analysis (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).
- Build a Streamlit app for interactive sentiment analysis.
